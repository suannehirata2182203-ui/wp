                            <h2>Hi, I'm Anna</h2>
                            <p>I never planned to become an expert in shipping fragile packages. Like many people, I found myself in a situation where I needed to send something delicate to family members in another country, and I had no idea what I was doing.</p>
                            <p>That first shipment—my grandmother's crystal collection—ended in disaster. But instead of giving up, I became determined to figure out how to do it right. Three years and over fifty successful shipments later, I've learned more than I ever expected about international fragile shipping.</p>

                    <section class="about-story">
                        <h2>How This Started</h2>
                        <p>I'm originally from Warsaw, Poland, where I've lived most of my life. My family is spread across Europe—my mother's side in Germany, my father's cousins in the UK, and various relatives in other countries. When my grandmother passed away, I inherited her collection of vintage crystal and glassware, and I wanted to share pieces with family members who couldn't be there.</p>
                        <p>That first attempt was a complete failure. I wrapped everything in newspaper, put it in a single box, and sent it off with the Polish postal service. When my cousin in Berlin received it, most of the items were broken. I was devastated, not just because of the loss, but because I felt I'd failed to honor my grandmother's memory.</p>
                        <p>That's when I decided to learn everything I could about shipping fragile items properly. I spent months researching, testing different packaging methods, trying various shipping services, and learning about customs requirements. Each shipment taught me something new, and gradually, I developed methods that consistently worked.</p>

                    <section class="about-experience">
                        <h2>What I've Learned</h2>
                        <p>Over the past three years, I've shipped:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Vintage crystal collections</li>
                            <li>Porcelain dinnerware sets</li>
                            <li>Framed glass artwork</li>
                            <li>Laboratory glassware</li>
                            <li>Decorative glass items</li>
                            <li>Ceramic collectibles</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I've used major shipping services available in Poland, tested countless packaging techniques, navigated customs requirements for multiple countries, and learned from both successes and failures.</p>
                        <p>Out of over fifty shipments, only two have arrived damaged—and both were due to courier handling issues that no packaging could have prevented. The rest arrived safely, thanks to the methods I've developed and refined.</p>

                    <section class="about-mission">
                        <h2>Why I Created This Site</h2>
                        <p>I created this website because I remember how overwhelming it felt when I first tried to ship fragile items. There's a lot of generic advice out there, but not much based on real, hands-on experience.</p>
                        <p>I wanted to share what actually works, not just what sounds good in theory. Every technique I recommend has been tested through actual shipments. Every shipping service I review has been used personally. Every mistake I warn about is one I've made myself.</p>
                        <p>My goal is to help others avoid the frustration and loss I experienced with that first shipment. If I can help even one person successfully deliver a fragile package to a loved one, this site will have served its purpose.</p>

                        <p>I'm based in Warsaw, Poland, and I'm always happy to help fellow shippers navigate the challenges of international fragile package delivery.</p>
