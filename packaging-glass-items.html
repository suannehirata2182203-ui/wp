                        <h2>The First Package That Broke</h2>
                        <p>My first attempt at shipping glassware was a disaster. I wrapped three crystal vases in newspaper, placed them in a single box with some crumpled paper for padding, and sent them off. Two weeks later, my cousin in Berlin received a box full of glass shards. That failure taught me more than any guidebook ever could.</p>
                        <p>Since then, I've packaged over thirty glass shipments, and only one has arrived damaged—and that was due to improper handling by the courier, not my packaging. Here's what I've learned works consistently.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Materials That Make the Difference</h2>
                        <p>Not all protective materials are created equal. After testing various options, I've settled on a combination that has proven reliable:</p>
                        
                        <h3>Bubble Wrap: The Foundation</h3>
                        <p>I use medium-sized bubble wrap (10mm bubbles) for most glass items. The key is wrapping each piece individually, not just placing it between layers. Wrap each item completely, ensuring no glass surface touches another item or the box directly.</p>
                        <p>For extremely fragile items like thin wine glasses, I use two layers of bubble wrap. The first layer goes around the item, and the second layer wraps the entire bundle again.</p>

                        <h3>Corrugated Cardboard Dividers</h3>
                        <p>Single-wall corrugated cardboard dividers create compartments within your box. I cut them to fit snugly, creating individual cells for each glass item. This prevents items from shifting and colliding during transit.</p>
                        <p>According to packaging experts at <a href="https://www.packagingdigest.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Packaging Digest</a>, proper compartmentalization can reduce breakage rates by up to 70% compared to loose packing.</p>

                        <h3>Air Cushioning Systems</h3>
                        <p>For larger boxes, I fill empty spaces with air pillows or inflatable packaging. These provide cushioning while keeping the package weight manageable. Unlike packing peanuts, they don't settle or create pressure points.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>The Step-by-Step Process</h2>
                        <p>Here's my exact process, refined through trial and error:</p>

                        <h3>Step 1: Individual Wrapping</h3>
                        <p>Each glass item gets wrapped individually in bubble wrap. I start by placing the item in the center of a sheet of bubble wrap, then fold the edges over, creating a tight seal. For items with stems or handles, I pay special attention to these vulnerable areas, adding extra padding.</p>

                        <h3>Step 2: Creating Compartments</h3>
                        <p>I measure my box and cut cardboard dividers to create individual compartments. Each compartment should be slightly larger than the wrapped item, allowing for a small amount of movement but not enough for collision.</p>

                        <h3>Step 3: Layering</h3>
                        <p>I place a layer of bubble wrap at the bottom of the box, then arrange the wrapped items in their compartments. Between layers, I add another sheet of bubble wrap. The top layer also gets bubble wrap before I close the box.</p>

                        <h3>Step 4: Final Protection</h3>
                        <p>I fill any remaining gaps with air cushions, ensuring nothing can shift. The box should feel full but not tight—items shouldn't be compressed, but they also shouldn't have room to move around.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
                        <p>I've made most of these mistakes myself, so learn from my errors:</p>

                        <h3>Using Newspaper Alone</h3>
                        <p>Newspaper provides minimal protection. It compresses under pressure and doesn't absorb shock effectively. Always use proper bubble wrap or foam padding.</p>

                        <h3>Overpacking</h3>
                        <p>Filling a box too tightly can cause pressure points that lead to breakage. Items need some space to absorb impact, but not enough to move freely.</p>

                        <h3>Ignoring the Box Quality</h3>
                        <p>A flimsy box will fail regardless of your internal packaging. Use double-wall corrugated boxes for glass items. I source mine from <a href="https://www.uline.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Uline</a> or local Polish packaging suppliers.</p>

                        <h3>Forgetting to Mark the Package</h3>
                        <p>Always mark packages containing fragile items clearly. I use "FRAGILE" stickers on all sides of the box, plus "GLASS" labels if applicable. While not all couriers respect these labels, many do, and it's better to have them than not.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Special Considerations for Different Glass Types</h2>

                        <h3>Crystal and Lead Glass</h3>
                        <p>Crystal items are heavier and more prone to chipping. I use extra padding around edges and rims, and I never pack crystal items with other types of glass—the weight difference can cause damage.</p>

                        <h3>Thin Glassware</h3>
                        <p>Wine glasses, champagne flutes, and other thin glassware require the most care. I wrap each piece individually, then create a secondary wrap that includes extra padding around the stem or base.</p>

                        <h3>Large Glass Items</h3>
                        <p>For mirrors or large glass panels, I use foam board on both sides, then wrap the entire assembly in bubble wrap. These items need a custom-sized box to prevent any movement.</p>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Real Results</h2>
                        <p>Using these techniques, I've successfully shipped:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>12-piece crystal dinnerware sets</li>
                            <li>Vintage glass collectibles</li>
                            <li>Framed glass artwork</li>
                            <li>Laboratory glassware</li>
                            <li>Decorative glass vases and bowls</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Out of 35 packages shipped using these methods, 34 arrived completely intact. The one that didn't was due to the courier dropping the package from a significant height, which no packaging could have prevented.</p>
