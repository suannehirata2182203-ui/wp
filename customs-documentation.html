                        <h2>The Package That Got Stuck</h2>
                        <p>My third shipment to Germany was held at customs for three weeks. Not because of the contents—the glassware was perfectly legal—but because I'd filled out the customs form incorrectly. I'd underestimated the value, used vague descriptions, and forgotten to include the proper codes. That experience taught me that paperwork can be just as important as packaging.</p>
                        <p>Since then, I've learned the ins and outs of customs documentation for international shipments from Poland. Here's everything you need to know to avoid delays and ensure your fragile packages clear customs smoothly.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Essential Documents</h2>
                        <p>Every international shipment from Poland requires specific documentation. Missing or incorrect forms can delay your package for weeks or even result in it being returned.</p>

                        <h3>CN22 Form (Small Packages)</h3>
                        <p>For packages under 2kg and valued under a certain threshold (varies by destination), you'll need a CN22 customs declaration form. This is a small green label that attaches to your package.</p>
                        <p><strong>Key fields to fill correctly:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Description:</strong> Be specific. "Glass vase" is better than "decoration." Include material, type, and purpose.</li>
                            <li><strong>Quantity:</strong> Exact number of items, not "assorted" or "various."</li>
                            <li><strong>Weight:</strong> Accurate weight in kilograms.</li>
                            <li><strong>Value:</strong> Honest market value in the destination country's currency or euros.</li>
                            <li><strong>Country of Origin:</strong> Usually "Poland" for items purchased there.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I learned the hard way that vague descriptions like "household items" or "gifts" often trigger additional inspections. Be specific but concise.</p>

                        <h3>CN23 Form (Larger Packages)</h3>
                        <p>For packages over 2kg or higher value, you'll need a CN23 form. This is more detailed and requires additional information.</p>
                        <p><strong>Additional information required:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Detailed itemized list of contents</li>
                            <li>Individual values for each item</li>
                            <li>HS (Harmonized System) codes if known</li>
                            <li>Purpose of shipment (gift, commercial, personal effects)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Commercial Invoice</h3>
                        <p>For commercial shipments or high-value items, you may need a commercial invoice. Even for personal shipments, some couriers require this for packages over certain values.</p>
                        <p>The invoice should include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sender and recipient details</li>
                            <li>Detailed description of items</li>
                            <li>Individual and total values</li>
                            <li>Currency</li>
                            <li>Reason for export</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Common Mistakes That Cause Delays</h2>
                        <p>I've made most of these mistakes, and they all resulted in delays:</p>

                        <h3>Understating Value</h3>
                        <p>It's tempting to undervalue items to reduce customs fees, but this is illegal and can result in your package being held, returned, or even confiscated. Always declare the honest market value.</p>
                        <p>Customs authorities have access to databases and can verify values. If they suspect undervaluation, they'll hold your package for inspection, which can take weeks.</p>

                        <h3>Vague Descriptions</h3>
                        <p>"Glass items" or "fragile items" isn't specific enough. Customs needs to know exactly what you're shipping. Use descriptions like "crystal wine glasses" or "ceramic dinner plates."</p>
                        <p>I now use a format like: "[Material] [Type] [Purpose]" - for example, "Crystal wine glasses, set of 6" or "Porcelain dinner plates, decorative."</p>

                        <h3>Incorrect HS Codes</h3>
                        <p>HS (Harmonized System) codes classify products for customs purposes. While not always required for small personal shipments, including them can speed up processing.</p>
                        <p>For glassware, common codes include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>7013.99 - Glassware of a kind used for table, kitchen, toilet, office, indoor decoration</li>
                            <li>6911.10 - Tableware and kitchenware of porcelain or china</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>You can find HS codes using the <a href="https://www.trade.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. International Trade Administration</a> database or similar resources for your destination country.</p>

                        <h3>Missing Recipient Information</h3>
                        <p>Incomplete recipient details are a common cause of delays. Ensure you have:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Full legal name (not nicknames)</li>
                            <li>Complete address including postal code</li>
                            <li>Phone number (often required)</li>
                            <li>Email address (for some couriers)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Destination-Specific Requirements</h2>
                        <p>Different countries have different requirements. Here's what I've learned about common destinations:</p>

                        <h3>European Union Countries</h3>
                        <p>Since Poland is in the EU, shipments to other EU countries are generally simpler. However, you still need proper documentation, especially for packages over certain values.</p>
                        <p>For EU destinations, I typically use CN22 or CN23 forms, and the process is usually straightforward. Delivery times are faster, and customs clearance is typically automatic for personal shipments.</p>

                        <h3>United States</h3>
                        <p>U.S. customs requires detailed documentation. I've found that including a commercial invoice, even for personal shipments, speeds up the process.</p>
                        <p>U.S. customs may hold packages for inspection if:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Value is over $800 (personal exemption limit)</li>
                            <li>Description is vague</li>
                            <li>Multiple items aren't itemized</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>United Kingdom</h3>
                        <p>Post-Brexit, UK customs requirements have changed. Packages now require proper customs declarations, and recipients may need to pay VAT and customs duties on items over certain values.</p>
                        <p>I always include detailed descriptions and accurate values for UK shipments, as they're more likely to be inspected.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <h2>Gift vs. Commercial Shipment</h2>
                        <p>How you classify your shipment matters:</p>

                        <h3>Gift Shipments</h3>
                        <p>For genuine gifts, mark the package as "Gift" on the customs form. However, you still need to declare the value accurately. Many countries have lower thresholds for gifts before customs duties apply.</p>
                        <p>Be honest—if you're shipping items you purchased for someone, it's still a gift, but the value must be accurate.</p>

                        <h3>Commercial Shipments</h3>
                        <p>If you're selling items or shipping for commercial purposes, you must mark it as such. Commercial shipments have different requirements and may require additional documentation.</p>

                        <h2>Tips for Smooth Customs Clearance</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Be honest:</strong> Accurate information prevents delays and legal issues.</li>
                            <li><strong>Be specific:</strong> Detailed descriptions help customs classify items quickly.</li>
                            <li><strong>Include all required documents:</strong> Missing forms cause automatic delays.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use proper packaging:</strong> Well-packaged items are less likely to be opened for inspection.</li>
                            <li><strong>Keep copies:</strong> Always keep copies of all documentation you submit.</li>
                            <li><strong>Check destination requirements:</strong> Some countries have restrictions on certain items.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>When Packages Get Held</h2>
                        <p>If your package is held at customs, don't panic. Common reasons include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Missing or incomplete documentation</li>
                            <li>Vague descriptions requiring clarification</li>
                            <li>Random inspection (normal procedure)</li>
                            <li>Value verification</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Most couriers will notify you or the recipient if additional information is needed. Respond promptly to avoid further delays.</p>
